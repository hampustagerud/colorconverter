# ColorConverter
Small python application for breaking down hex colors to components and then being able to print the list using a format specified by the user.

## Colors
Colors are written with following syntax: 

```
Name:Hex
```

Name can be any string while Hex must be a string starting with "#". The rest of the letters must be 0-F and the value can be using 3, 4, 6 or 8 bytes (#000 (rgb), #0000 (rgba), #000000 (rgb), #00000000 (rgba)). If no alpha channel is supplied, the value is set to 255 by default.

Name and Hex must be seperated by a colon (':') but any whitespace added for readability should be stripped.

## Application
Application is written with Python3 ~and currently not backwards compatible with Python2 :(~ but should work fine with Python2 now :)

```
Commands:
? - Prints help text
q - Exit application
exit - Exit application
color [name:hex] - Add color with specified name and hex value
print [filename] - Print list of all colors using a specified format, prints to file if filename is provided
file [filenames] - Loads one or more text files with colors
```

## Files
Files are simple textfiles using following format:
```
# Comments goes here
[Name:Hex]

# Examples
Black:#000000
White:#FFF
Green:#00FF00FF
```

## Future
- [ ] Comment code
- [ ] Ability to use RGB(A) for constructing Color objects
- [x] Python2 compability
